"""
Dictionary is an unordered, they are dynamic, mutable (you can change them).

They are different than lists because:
    - Lists are accessed by their position like 0, 1, 2, 3, but dictionaries are accessed by a key"""

#We can define a dictionary by a pair of curly brackets

dictionary = {}

#To add a value to a dictionary we need a key and a value seperated by a colon (:)

dictionary = {
    'key': "value"
}

#If we want to access we can retrive the value from the dictionary using a pair of square brackets [] and the key

print(dictionary['key']) # It will output 'value'

#To add more than one key to a dictionary we need seperate them by a comma (,)
dictionary = {
    'car': "Ford",
    'year': 2018

}

#If we need to change a value in a key we can:

dictionary['car'] = "BMW"
print(dictionary['car']) #Instead outputting 'Ford' it will output 'BMW'

#Because dictionaries are dynamic, we can add more values without needing to create a new dictionary

dictionary['Model'] = "i3"
print(dictionary) #It will output {'car': 'Ford', 'year': 2018, 'Model':'i3'} It printed the new key and value  that we defined


#To remove a single value:
del dictionary['car']
print(dictionary) # It will output {'year': 2018, 'Model':'i3'}
#To Remove the WHOLE dictionary is simple:
del dictionary
print(dictionary) # It will output ValueError: 'dictionary' is not defined.
